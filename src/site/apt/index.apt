What is OAK Android Kit?

 OAK is a powerful kit of tools and components to use in your Android project

  * Image caching with transformations (rounded bitmaps? no problem)

  * Pinned Header List view - mimic the functionality of the contacts app

  * {{{./section-adapter.html}SectionAdapter with Pinned Headers}} - Same as above but with search filtering

  * {{{./resized_textview.html}ResizedTextView}} - Auto-resizing textview makes long content smaller

  * {{{./cancel_edit_text.html}CancelEditText}} - An EditText that lets you specify a tappable drawable
  to clear the field

  * TextViewWithFont - Drop your fonts in "assets/fonts" and use this handy component to set a custom font

Credits

  * OAK contains re-packaged classes from Matthias KŠppler's {{{https://github.com/kaeppler/droid-fu}Droid-Fu}} library.
